Hi there, 

my name is Christian, I am the chairman of the board of the Bürgerrunde Heuweiler (BR). 

Heuweiler is a small community in southern Germany. The BR is a small team of dedicated citizens. However, we are doing our best to fight climate change locally. Our topics are mobility, safety and climate protection. Our goal is to become a fully climate-neutral community by 2030.

We just purchased a modern Urban Arrow Family cargo electric bike for our village:
https://www.urbanarrow.com/en/family

The bike is supported by local businesses and the local community. The BR will provide regular maintenance for the bike.
The bike will have a central public location and can be used freely and at no cost by all inhabitants for all their transport needs (children, dogs, tools, sports equipment, picknicks, shopping, etc.). 

We would like you to design large stickers on *both* sides of the cargo box. 
We will print the stickers ourselves, locally.
Please note that we do NOT need a logo.

People should know what the bike is for and who operates and supports the bike.
The design should be simple, minimalistic, fresh, easy to read, beautiful to look at and maybe just a little playful. 
Please be creative. All designs and suggestions are welcome.

Please pay attention to the following for the design of the stickers:

- as the bike frame is white and we want the base/background of our stickers to be white also
- the name of the bike is "Henry"/"Heidi"
- the slogan is "Mein - dein - unser Lastenrad", which is german and translates to "my, your, our cargo bike"
- most important is the slogan and the name of the bike, so both should be large and easy to read
- a QRcode, which points to a website with more info
- the two website urls: https://buergerrunde.heuweiler.net and https://www.lastenvelofreiburg.de/
- we have 6 logos in total (rewe, ews, lexware, bürgerrunde, lastenvelo, heuweiler), most of the files are already in vector format
- all logos should be unobtrusive, maybe placed in a single row below the name/slogan. All logos should be the same size, small but readable.
- we would optionally like to see a nice graphical element. Like a silhouette of Heuweiler. Or something else, which makes it clear that the bike belongs to the villagers and that we are caring for better mobility, the environment and the climate
- main colors should be the orange colors of our logo (BR), but you are also free to use other colors
- the charging station for the bike will look like this:

You can find all files, images and logos in this dropbox folder:

Additionally we need a separate sign for the bike location. The sign should be printable in max A3 format and should have the same design as the stickers with the following additional title:
"Dieser Platz ist reserviert für", which translates to "This space is reserved for".

Included is an .ai file which the manufacturer of the bike provided, together with some instructions. Please use this file for your designs.
As the final result, please create and deliver full vector files (AI, PDF) for print.
