Learn the easiest and most professional-looking way to do appliquÃ© with your home sewing machine.

I was so shocked when I discovered this easy yet professional-looking appliquÃ© technique using my home sewing machine (Iâ€™m using [Singer Heavy Duty 4452](https://www.singer.com/heavy-duty-4452-sewing-machine)). I just had to share it with all of you!

## How to Machine Applique with Satin Stitch with Your Home Sewing Machine

**Step 1.** Prepare your shape and cut it out from your chosen fabric. For my example, I simply drew a giant star on a piece of paper and cut it out using a scrap fabric I had at home.

**Step 2.** Place your shaped piece on the fabric to which you want to attach it. For this step, I used fabric glue to ensure it stays in place. I'm attaching my piece to a scrap of canvas fabric.

**Step 3.** Now it's time for sewing! Set your sewing machine with the following settings and test on a scrap fabric to ensure everything is in order:

- Width: It depends on your desirable style, but I prefer 3 or 4 (medium width). I used 4 in this tutorial.
- Length: Use the buttonhole length setting.
- Stitch Style: Choose the basic zigzag style.

**Step 4:** While sewing, ensure that the edge of your shaped piece lines up with the marked line in the picture. Note that if your width setting is different, you may want to test it on a scrap piece of fabric to determine where you want to align the needle.

ðŸ’  I tested this on a thick burlap fabric, hoping I can use this technique for making gift bags. (I was thinking I should put the initial of the person Iâ€™m gifting to or a heartðŸ’—) and this worked so great. I'll definitely make another tutorial on how to make those gift bags soon!
