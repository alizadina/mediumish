Upgrade your gift presentation in a flash with this 10-minute DIY for Burlap Gift Envelopes. Discover the easy way to add a touch of sophistication to your presents.üéÅ


## Gather Your Materials:

- 100% Jute Burlap Fabric
- [3-4mm Jute Twine String](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7TMZNVP?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
- Sewing clips (or pins)
- Fabric scissors
- Ruler
- Sewing machine, needle, coordinating thread
- Fabric marking pen or pencil
- Other optional sewing supplies (seam creaser, sewing scissors & shears, etc. . .)

üí† Instead of jute twine string, you can use anything like satin strap, twill tape, or holiday-themed ribbon!

## Step 1. Measure Your Gift Size & Cut the Fabric

1. Measure the desired size for your gift envelope. In my case, I needed it to be precisely 8 1/2 by 8 1/2 inches.
2. For the front piece, incorporate a 1/2-inch seam allowance on all sides, resulting in final dimensions of 9 1/2 by 9 1/2 inches for my case.
3. Calculate the dimensions for the back piece as follows: Width + 1 inch (seam allowance) by Height + 1/2 Height + 1 inch (seam allowance). For example, my back piece will be 9 1/2 by 13 3/4 inches.
4. Proceed to cut the fabric!

## Step 2. Make the Envelope! ‚úâÔ∏è

üí† This burlap gift envelope is versatile and suits various gifts such as clothing, kitchen goods, or books! Its boho, vintage, effortless, minimalistic, and sophisticated appearance has garnered me numerous compliments.
