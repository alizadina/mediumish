# ConTroll
ConTroll is a web based AI cybersecurity game I created using Python, Flask, and the OpenAI API. The game is built like all OpenAI based chat-bots and has a hidden system prompt. Your goal is to enter something into the chat input field that will convince OpenAI to respond in a way that reveals the password hidden in the system prompt.  
  
Each level has a different system prompt that uses various natural language methods to protect the information in that prompt.
