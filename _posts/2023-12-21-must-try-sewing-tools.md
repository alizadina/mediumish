## 1. Seam Measuring Gauge

This tiny measuring tool is perfect for checking small measurements when you are sewing or quilting. I use it frequently to mark seam allowances accurately. Personally, I struggle with eyeballing measurements, and this tool helps ensure that my seams are consistent and perfect. It is pretty affordable, costing about $3-6.

## 2. Fabric Marking Pen / Erasable Pen

These erasable pens are lifesavers. They were incredibly helpful during my days of hand-drafting patterns in fashion school. They are super useful for marking fabrics in your sewing projects, and I can't imagine sewing without them. While a bit pricier than regular pens, they are totally worth it. However, be cautious when using these pens to label your patterns, as the markings may disappear with heat, and sometimes they fade away after exposure to hot summer conditions, which you definitely want to avoid.

PILOT FriXion is my personal favorite brand, offering a variety of color choices and pen types (highlighters, markers, ballpoints, etc.). The best part is that they are a bit cheaper than pens labeled specifically as "fabric marking pens." If you're interested, you can check them out [here](https://www.amazon.com/PILOT-Erasable-Refillable-Retractable-Assorted/dp/B085WRNYZB/ref=asc_df_B085WRNYZB/?tag=&linkCode=df0&hvadid=416655986074&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3614904098988213752&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9030930&hvtargid=pla-908701735398&mcid=0fa38f1e524b3d4d8c05005b01cf892e&ref=&adgrpid=93602480333&gclid=Cj0KCQiA4Y-sBhC6ARIsAGXF1g5lZJdTEqVuLPuu-6aMXj2lx63a1z6PgmQ8Nmfof4ukXnr7gWQOysgaAs7DEALw_wcB&th=1).

## 3. Pinking Shears Scissors for Fabric 

These pinking shears are incredibly useful for preventing fabric fraying and adding a pretty decorative edge to seams. They are particularly handy for those who don't have a serger machine at home. While my home sewing machine has various decorative stitches like zig-zag, it can be slow and sometimes you just don't want to deal with it, right? With these pinking shears, you can simply cut the seam allowances awayâ€”easy and quick!

You can also use these shears to cut fabric swatches neatly and nicely, making them perfect for your portfolio or any fashion design projects. It really gives a nice and professional touch.

## 4. Loop Turner

These are must-have items if you enjoy creating clothing with lots of intricate straps. I particularly love back strappy details, and this tool is incredibly useful for making various sizes of spaghetti straps. Not only is it great for spaghetti straps, but it is also incredibly helpful for belts. It truly simplifies the tedious and frustrating process of turning narrow fabric tubes right side out. Sometimes, I even find joy in flipping with this loop turnerâ€”it gives me a sense of satisfaction. ðŸ™ƒ

## 5. Overcast Pressor Foot
If you don't have a serger and want to imitate the overlock stitch for finishing fabric edges, the overcast presser foot will be your best friend. It is very easy and straightforward to set up, and it works so well. I use this foot quite a lot when I want to make the seam finish super neat and nice without anything fraying. Here's a quick [link](https://youtu.be/sniKL1bP4xQ?si=9lZgvHRZHt8cIIxR) to show you how it works.

## 6. Hot Hemmer 

A hot hemmer is a heat-resistant ruler, and this is so, so, so helpful. When you press hems before you sew, it provides a straight and consistent guide for folding fabric. For a person who is really bad at eyeballing measurements (like me ðŸ˜­), this is very, very helpful for precise hems without spending every single minute measuring before pressing, which is very time-consuming.

## 7. Fabric Glue Pen

This will make your sewing so much easier. You can't go wrong with this item. It works very well for holding seams together or holding binding pieces in place without pinning. You can also use this to glue down curved seam allowances or hold buttons or elastics in place for machine sewing or so much more.

ðŸ’  Those are the 7 optional sewing tools that I think are incredible additions to your basic toolkit. My personal favorite is probably the overcast pressor foot. What do you guys think? If there are any other tools that you love, comment down below!
