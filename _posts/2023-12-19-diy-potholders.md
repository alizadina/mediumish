Elevate your kitchen with super-simple DIY potholders. Let's get creative effortlessly for fabulous results!ðŸ§µ


## Gather Your Materials:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post1/1.jpg" alt="Potholder Materials" style="width:100%;">

- A quarter yard of fabric or scraps of cotton or linen fabric
- [Insul-bright insulating batting (Thermal batting)](https://www.amazon.com/Insul-Bright-Needlepunched-Insulated-Lining-yard/dp/B000YZ7CQG)
- Bowl with a diameter between 8 and 9 inches (only for the circle potholder)
- Sewing clips (or pins)
- Fabric scissors
- Ruler
- Sewing machine, needle, coordinating thread
- Fabric marking pen or pencil
- Other optional sewing supplies (seam creaser, loop turner, sewing scissors & shears, walking foot, etc. . .)

ðŸ’  With a quarter yard of fabric (18in x 21in), you can make exactly one circle potholder and one square potholder.

## How to Make a Potholder - Tutorial


#### Step 1. Cut the Fabric and Thermal Batting

##### For Squareâ¬œ Potholder:

- cut two 8" squares from fabric
- cut two 8" squares from thermal batting
- cut one 6" by 2" rectangle from fabric (hanging loop)

##### For Circleâšª Potholder:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/post1/3.jpg" alt="Circle Potholder Sample Cut" style="width:100%;">

- cut two 8-9" diameter circles from fabric
- cut two 8-9" diameter circles from thermal batting
- cut one 6" by 2" rectangle from fabric (hanging loop)

ðŸ’  You can use any bowl with a diameter between 8 and 9 inches to trace the circle.

#### Step 2. Make the Hanging Loop

1. Fold the hanging loop fabric piece with right sides together.
2. Stitch with a 1/2" seam allowance.
3. Press it well.
4. Trim the seam allowance to 1/8" inch.
5. Make a tiny hole 1/4 to 1/2 inch from one end.
6. Slide the loop turner into the tube and insert the hook into the hole made in step 5.

<ol start="7">
  <li>If it's properly latched, pull the turner in your direction by gently massaging the fabric on the hook to turn the strap inside out.</li>
  <li>Continue guiding the fabric, ensuring the hook stays engaged, until the strap has been fully inverted.</li>
  <li>Press it well again.</li>
  <li>Trim any frayed edges. The strap was cut longer than needed, so don't hesitate to cut away any excess.</li>
</ol>

ðŸ’  There are multiple techniques for crafting the hanging loop. If using a loop turner feels too advanced or uncomfortable, consider an alternative method. 
1. Start by folding each side by 1/4" on the wrong side and stitching. 
2. Then, press and fold on the right side. 
3. Secure the folds with a top stitch to create the strap. 

This alternative may be a more straightforward option for you.

#### Step 3. Create the Quilt Design (Optional)

ðŸ’  Please note that this step is entirely optional. In my examples, I opted for quilt stitching only for the circle potholder.
